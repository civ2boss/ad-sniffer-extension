# Ad Sniffer Extension

This is a Chrome extension that will log all DFP ad requests with status 200 and display a table with some pertinient metadata from the requests.

I got tired of digging through the network tab to debug ad calls, so I made this extension.

Please enjoy; feature requests should be referred to the [circular file](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/circular_file).
